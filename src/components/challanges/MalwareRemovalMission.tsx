            <h1>Mission 3: Malware Removal – Clean the Orion Shield System</h1>
            <p>Impressive work! You’ve successfully broken into the Orion Shield System, but the battle is far from
                over. While we’ve regained access to the satellites, there’s another problem—alien malware is lurking in
                the code, and it’s sabotaging our systems.</p>

            <p>The alien invaders have infected the software with malicious code, designed to cripple the Orion Shield
                from the inside. If we don’t eliminate it, the system will fall apart, leaving Earth vulnerable to
                attack.</p>

            <p>Your next mission is to <strong>remove the alien malware</strong> without damaging our own critical code.
                You’ll need to carefully search through the software, identifying the malware using your <strong>RegEx
                    skills</strong> and removing it. But be cautious—one wrong move, and you could erase vital parts of
                our system.</p>

            <p>This isn’t just about finding the right patterns; it’s about precision and care. The malware is woven
                into our own code, making this a delicate task. If you succeed, the Orion Shield will be restored to
                full functionality. If you fail, we’ll lose everything.</p>

            <p><strong>The clock is ticking.</strong> You must remove the alien malware while keeping Earth’s defense
                systems intact. The survival of the planet depends on your accuracy.</p>
