# Alien Invasion: Developer's Call Game

This is a submission for the [Dev.to Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/introducing-our-first-community-web-game-challenge-1loo).

## About the Game

In **Alien Invasion: Developer's Call**, the year is 2054, and Earth is under attack—not with guns or bombs, but with alien code. The aliens have sabotaged Earth's digital infrastructure, rendering all of our defenses useless. Our only hope is to fight back in the digital world.

As a developer, you are humanity's last line of defense. Throughout the game, you will face a series of coding challenges that test your problem-solving skills and programming knowledge. These challenges include:

- **Vim Snake**: Prove your mastery of Vim by achieving a high score in the classic Snake game.
- **RegExp Missions**: Use regular expressions to solve puzzles, find hidden codes, and break into alien systems.
- **Malware Removal**: Use your coding expertise to clean up malware infecting Earth’s defense systems, without deleting critical code.
- **Turret Defense**: Write targeting algorithms to control Earth's last standing turrets and fend off the alien fleet.
